### Setting up the development environment
Follow the steps provided in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to set up the project and run the server and client locally.

### Workflow
1. Create an issue or pick an existing one to work on. Fork the repository and create a new branch with the following naming convention:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <issue_number>-<issue_title>
    ```
    For instance if you are working on issue #1, you can name your branch `1-add-readme`.

3. Push your changes
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```
4. Create a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository.
5. Link the issue in the pull request description. Example:
    ```markdown
    ### Linked issues
    - Closes #<issue_number>
    ```
6. Wait for the code to be reviewed and approved.
